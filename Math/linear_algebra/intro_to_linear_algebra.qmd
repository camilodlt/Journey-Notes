What is Linear Algebra ? 

Linear Algebra is the study of **linear operations** on **vector spaces**.

What is a linear operation then ... 

Let $V$ and $W$ be vector spaces. 
A function $f: V \rightarrow W$ is a linear map if for any two vectors $\textbf{u}$ and $\textbf{v}$ the mapping is _operation preserving_, that is, it satisfies these conditions: 

- _Additivity_ : $f(\textbf{u} + \textbf{v}) = f(\textbf{u}) + f(\textbf{v})$

- _Homogeneity_ of scalar multiplication : $f(c\textbf{u}) = c*f(\textbf{u})$


For example : 


$$
\begin{align*}
    \begin{split}
        \textbf{a} = [0, 1] \\
        \textbf{b} = [1 ,1] \\
        \text{The function } f(a,b) = (3a,b) \text{works since: }
    \end{split}


    f(a+b) = f([0,1] + [1,1]) = f([1,2]) = (3,2)
    f(a) + f(b) = [0,1] + [3,1] = [3,2]

    f(a + [3,3] ) = f([0,1] + [3,3]) = f([3,4]) = [9,4]
    equal to 
    f(a + [3,3]) = f(a) + f([3,3]) = [0,1] + [9,3] = [9,4]


    It preserves the multiplication, for ex lambda = 2: 
    f(\lambda * a) = f(2*[0,1]) = f([0,2]) = [0,2]
    Which is the same as : 
    f(\lambda * a) = \lambda * f(a) = 2 * [0,1] = [0,2]

\end{align*}
$$
